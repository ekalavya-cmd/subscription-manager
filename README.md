**Managing Subscriptions**

- **Add a Subscription:**

  1.  Click the "Add" button in the "Add/Edit Subscription" form.
  2.  Fill in the fields: Name (e.g., "Netflix"), Cost (e.g., "1200" in INR), Renewal Date (eg., "2025-04-20"), Provider (e.g., "Netflix Inc."), and Status (e.g., "Active").
  3.  Click "Add" to save. A "Subscription added successfully!" message will appear.
  4.  Use "Clear" to reset the form.

- **Edit a Subscription:**

  1.  Find the subscription in the table and click "Edit".
  2.  Modify any field (e.g., change cost to "1300") and click "Update".
  3.  A "Subscription updated successfully!" message will confirm the change.
  4.  Click "Cancel" to discard edits.

- **Delete a Subscription:**

**Sending SMS Reminders**

  2.  Enter a recipient phone number (e.g., "+919876543210") and a message (e.g., "Your Netflix subscription renews on 2025-04-20!").
  3.  Click "Send SMS". A "SMS sent successfully" message will appear if successful, or an error if fields are missing.

- Tips: Ensure the phone number includes the country code and that your Twilio account has credits.

**Viewing Costs**

- The "Monthly Cost Overview" chart displays the total cost of active subscriptions per month in 2025, labeled in INR.

## Twilio Usage

This project integrates Twilio for sending SMS reminders about subscription renewals. Here's how it's implemented:

- **Setup:**

  - A Twilio account is required. Sign up at Twilio and obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.
  - These credentials are stored in the `.env` file under `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`.

- **Functionality:**

  - The app includes an SMS form where users can enter a recipient phone number and a custom message.
  - Upon submission, the backend makes a POST request to Twilio's API (`/api/send-sms`) using the `twilio` npm package.
  - The message is sent from the Twilio phone number to the specified recipient.

- **Implementation:**

  - The `server.js` file contains the Twilio configuration and the `/send-sms` endpoint.
  - The frontend (AngularJS) handles the form submission and displays success/error messages.
  - Example usage: Enter a phone number (e.g., +919876543210) and a message like "Your subscription renews tomorrow!" to send a reminder.

- **Notes:**

  - Ensure your Twilio account has sufficient credits for SMS usage.
  - The app validates that both the phone number and message are provided before sending.
  - For production, configure Twilio to handle international numbers and comply with local regulations.
